						<h2>How does it work ?</h2>
						<p class="lead">Firstly, a satellite doesn't fly. It just fall constantly around the Earth. It's
							easy to explain : if
							you throw a stone, it will follow a parabola which lead to
							the ground, or if we want to be specific, to the center of Earth. When we reach a specific
							speed
							defined by the distance satellite/earth (cf <a
								href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/keplers-law#:~:text=Kepler's%20laws%20apply%3A,the%20same%20for%20all%20planets."
								target="blank">Kepler laws</a>), the satellite will
							follow the curve of Earth. To avoid the satellite to fall while losing speed due to friction
							with
							air particles, we need it to be over the atmosphere, where there is no
							friction force. At this altitude, there is no need to use any energy to maintain his
							movement. For
							example, the ISS which is close to earth, need every month to
							use some air to go up and keep a good distance and speed due to friction.</p>
						<p class="lead">Secondly, I will explain differents orbits and how do they work :<br>
							<span class="space"></span>• Low Earth orbit (LEO) : Geocentric orbits ranging in altitude
							from 180 km – 2,000 km (1,200
							mi). <span class="info-schema">(Cyan on schema)</span><br>
							<span class="space"></span>• Medium Earth orbit (MEO) : Geocentric orbits ranging in
							altitude from 2,000 km (1,200 mi) –
							35,786
							km (22,236 mi). Also known as an intermediate circular orbit. <span
								class="info-schema">(Yellow)</span><br>
							<span class="space"></span>• Geostationnary Earth Orbit (GEO) : Geocentric circular orbit
							with an altitude of 35,786
							kilometres
							(22,236 mi).
							The period of the orbit equals one sidereal day, coinciding with the rotation period of the
							Earth.
							The speed is 3,075 metres per second (10,090 ft/s).
							This orbit is used by communication & TV satellites. <span class="info-schema">(Black dashed
								line)</span><br>
							<span class="space"></span>• High Earth orbit (HEO): Geocentric orbits above the altitude of
							geosynchronous orbit 35,786 km
							(22,236 mi).<br>

						<h2>Project Starlink</h2>
						<h3>Explanation</h3>
						<p class="lead">The project Starlink's purpose is to grant access to Internet for everyone,
							everywhere on Earth.
							Nowadays, there is 5% of the population who don't have any internet access.</p>
						<p class="lead">How ? the project is about to launch 42 000 satellites to create a constellation
							of satellites. <br>
							In space, the solar-powered, 500-pound satellites communicate with one another through both
							optical
							and
							radio links; the entire network will then be connected with user terminals on the ground
							that can be
							installed basically anywhere with a view of the sky. With a large enough array of satellites
							passing
							overhead, internet service should be continually available, unlike the delays in
							connectivity that
							are common with current Iridium satellites and other networks.</p>
						<p class="lead">As well, SpaceX says each satellite will be “capable of tracking on-orbit debris
							and autonomously
							avoiding collision,” and that 95 percent of the satellites’ components will quickly
							disintegrate in
							Earth’s atmosphere during de-orbit at the ends of their lifetimes.</p>
						<p class="lead">In april 2018, there was 1 600 satellites over the world. Two years after, this
							amount just double
							due to this project.</p>
						<h3>Controversy & problems</h3>
						<p class="lead flex">Firstly, despite Musk’s initial assurances that the satellites will be
							barely noticeable, the
							train of spacecraft has been captured marching across skies around the globe, and some
							online
							tracking services can even calculate when and where someone can spot them sailing by
							overhead.
							<img src="sources/starlink.png" alt="Starlink constellation visible on space">
						</p>
						<p class="lead">Astronomers have also raised concerns about the constellations’ effect on
							ground-based astronomy and
							how the minifridge-size satellites will add to an already jammed orbital environment.<br>
							Like the Iridium satellites that preceded them, Starlink satellites can sometimes “flare” if
							their
							solar arrays are angled just right to throw a burst of reflected sunlight toward Earth,
							briefly
							boosting their apparent brightness to potentially rival Venus or Jupiter. <br>
							And even these revised estimates, which are based on the satellite’s final orbital altitudes
							and
							inclinations, suggest that they’ll be visible to unaided eyes from very dark sites.</p>
						<p class="lead">
							However, despite his initial insistence that Starlink’s components will be invisible and
							unproblematic for
							astronomy, Musk has said he’s directed his team to <span>think about ways of reducing
								Starlink’s
								reflectivity, or albedo.</p>
						<h3>What about legal approval ?</h3>
						<p class="lead">I will begin with the contextual background. If there is a problem with
							Starlink, it's not Musk's
							fault, it's on the country which allow the launch of these satellites to give a report on it
						</p>
						<p class="lead">SpaceX has already received approval from the International Telecommunications
							Union and the U.S.
							Federal Communications Commission to launch a total of 11,943 satellites. And assuming the
							Federal
							Aviation Administration continues to grant launch licenses for rockets with Starlink
							satellites on
							board, there’s no regulatory machinery in place to prevent the company from seeing its
							strategy
							through to completion.</p>
						<p class="lead">To be fair, SpaceX is not the only company with plans to assemble clouds of
							space-based internet
							satellites. Among those, Amazon is planning its 3,000 satellite-strong Project Kuiper, and
							OneWeb
							(which has already launched six satellites) intends to eventually send as many as 2,000
							spacecraft
							into orbit.</p>

						<h2>Militarisation of space</h2>
						<p class="lead">
							The militarisation of space involves the placement and development of weaponry and military
							technology in outer space. The early exploration of space in the mid-20th century had, in
							part, a
							military motivation, as the United States and the Soviet Union used it as an opportunity to
							demonstrate ballistic-missile technology and other technologies having the potential for
							military
							application.
						</p>
						<p class="lead">
							By the end of the 1960s, both countries regularly deployed satellites. Reconnaissance
							satellites were
							used by militaries to take accurate pictures of their rivals' military installations. As
							time passed
							the resolution and accuracy of orbital reconnaissance alarmed both sides of the iron
							curtain. Both
							the United States and the Soviet Union began to develop anti-satellite weapons to blind or
							destroy
							each other's satellites. Directed-energy weapons, kamikaze-style satellites, as well as
							orbital
							nuclear explosives were researched with varying levels of success. Spy satellites were, and
							continue
							to be, used to monitor the dismantling of military assets in accordance with arms control
							treaties
							signed between the two superpowers. To use spy satellites in such a manner is often referred
							to in
							treaties as "national technical means of verification".
						</p>
						<p class="lead">
							The superpowers developed ballistic missiles to enable them to use nuclear weaponry across
							great
							distances. As rocket science developed, the range of missiles increased and intercontinental
							ballistic missiles (ICBM) were created, which could strike virtually any target on Earth in
							a
							timeframe measured in minutes rather than hours or days. To cover large distances ballistic
							missiles
							are usually launched into sub-orbital spaceflight.
						</p>
						<p class="lead">The year after the first satellite was launch, URSS tried to destroy one
							satellite with an
							earth-space missile, they missed but they were satisfied about this launch.</p>
						<p class="lead">Nowadays, 4 country have already destroyed a satellite with an earth-space
							missile : China, USA,
							Russia & India.</p>
						<p class="lead">However, destroying satellites with missile cause a big problem : there is many
							debris which stay in
							space, which can cause many problems to others satellites, or more recently
							the ISS's astronauts must cancel an outside mission because of debris caused by the
							destruction of a
							russian satellite.</p>

						<h2>Spatial debris & ecology</h2>
						<p class="lead">Since 1957, the begining of space age, tons of launchers, vehicles and
							instuments has been sent
							into space. We had no relative informations about what to do with this objects at the end of
							their lives. We decided to ignore it and let them derive into space.
							Their number keep increasing, which cause many explosions and collisions, creating bilions
							of
							spatial debris.</p>
						<img src="sources/Distribution_of_space_debris_around_Earth.gif"
							alt="Modelisation of spatial debris around earth, gif">
						<p class="lead">For these reasons, some law appeared to ensure that we will reduce space debris.
							Formerly, we did
							use all the fuel and when there was no fuel left, we just left it where it was. <br>
							These days, we need to keep enough fuel to ensure a satellite will be ejected from his
							orbit.
							For a geostationary satellite, they eject it far away in the space. For a satellite in
							geocentric orbit, it will fall on earth and get burned by the atmosphere.</p>
						<p class="lead">There is a list of international norms & directives to follow :</p>
						<ul>
							<li>- Build launchers and space vehicle to avoid them to lose parts (when launch and during
								his
								operation)</li>
							<li>- Prevent explosion while liberating energy, to be sure a vehicle becomes passiv</li>
							<li>- When a mission is over, use the last fuel to quit orbits</li>
							<li>- Avoid collisions in space while chosing conscientiously their orbits and performing
								avoiding
								collisions process </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="lead">Actually, there is approximatively 9 600 tons of debris, 36 500 are more than
							10cm, 1 million are
							between 10cm and 1cm, and 330 millions between 1cm and 1 mm.</p>
						<p class="lead">To try to reduce this amount, some enterprise are working on a system with hook
							and net to catch
							debris and bring back on earth. <br>
							They also created some repair satellites, which can go near a satellite and repair it if
							necessary.</p>
